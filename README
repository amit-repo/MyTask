Task 1:
=>
Iterate through the json file and modify the value corresponding to quantity field according to specified grams of medicine(Eg. 25gm, 50gm, etc.)

Task 2:
=>
Url to tennis player record
name = "KeiNishikori"

#url="http://www.tennisabstract.com/cgi-bin/player.cgi?p="+name

Parse above url to check for variable having all reord informationi and extract js file to have corresponding data record.

Eg.
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.minorleaguesplits.com/tennisabstract/cgi-bin/jsmatches/KeiNishikori.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.minorleaguesplits.com/tennisabstract/cgi-bin/jsdoubles/KeiNishikori.js"></script>


var matchhead = ["date","tourn","surf","level","wl","rank","seed","entry","round",
                 "score","max","opp","orank","oseed","oentry","ohand","obday",
                 "oht","ocountry","oactive","time","aces","dfs","pts","firsts","fwon",
                 "swon",'games',"saved","chances","oaces","odfs","opts","ofirsts",
                 "ofwon","oswon",'ogames',"osaved","ochances", "obackhand", "chartlink",
                 "pslink","whserver","matchid","wh","roundnum","matchnum"]

From corresponding js file, we can see variable matchmx has all required values corresponding to matchhead.
Eg.
        var splits_head = matchhead;
        var splits_matches = matchmx;

So parse the js file to have all required information.

Formula used as per below:
1. ace % = (aces / pts) * 100
2. spw % = ((fown + swon) / pts) * 100
3. rpw % = (1 - ((ofwon + oswon) / opts)) * 100

{
    var rpw = 1 - (mt.ofwon + mt.oswon)/mt.opts;
    var spw = (mt.fwon + mt.swon)/mt.pts;
}
